        <p>“Fitzpleasure,” the album’s most frenetic and even schizophrenic composition, jumps between Gregorian chant to Afropop-tinged dubstep to ethereal electronica yet never feels contrived. Lyrically, it’s nearly indecipherable, obscured by Joe Newman’s nasal falsetto vocals that recall tribal singers from nearly any continent in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
